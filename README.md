# 👋 Hello there, I'm Bita!  

## _👩‍💻 Backend developer sharing about my journey and learnings in tech_

🛣️ I spent seven years in a knowledge-based IT company, gaining valuable experience across technology and business. Although my degree is in Marketing Management, my career path gradually sparked a passion for software development.

What began as curiosity has grown into a commitment to becoming a professional software engineer. I’m especially interested in backend development, system design, and modern programming tools, and I’m focused on building the expertise needed to contribute to impactful projects that deliver real value.

My combined background in business and IT gives me a broader perspective—helping me connect technical solutions with real-world needs. Moving forward, I’m dedicated to continuous learning, mastering advanced software engineering practices, and growing into roles where I can make a meaningful impact.
